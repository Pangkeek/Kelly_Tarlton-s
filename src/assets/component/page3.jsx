          Kelly Tarlton's Life is founded by Kelvin Ewart
          <br />

          <br />
          and dedicated his lives to Treasure Hunt and

          Shipwreck discovery

        <p className="text-white text-xl Light">
          On the official Kelly Tarlton's website, they started<br />"we often sell out during our busy periods such as<br />mornings weekends, school holidays and public<br />holiday". This suggest that mostly the target<br />consumer are high-school/middle schoolers and <br />juniors are the main guests that go to Kelly Tarlton's
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mt-6 text-xl Light">
          As the target consumers are young, accessibility<br/>would be considered in this AR porject. High<br/>contrasting colour, guides and easy to navigate-<br/>navigation system would needed to be<br/>implemented

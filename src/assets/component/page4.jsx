          For the research process, I decided to go to Kelly
          <br />
          Tarlton's Sea Life with my friends and interviews
          <br />
          some of the guests there, to know what our user
          <br />
          needs. By going to the actual Kelly Tarlton's Sea
          <br />
          Life, this allow us to see the user environment.

          interviews are good as it provide actual data from
          <br />
          our user.

          The most important findings from this interview are:
          <br />
          1. Most user think the current information
          <br />
          &emsp;display is outdated
